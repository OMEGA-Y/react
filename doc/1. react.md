## React vs Angular, Vue?

Vue: low usage

- Name: React : Angular
- Type: View Library : Framework
- Learning Curve: Short (Only View) : Long (View, Controller, Model, Router, Ajax, RxJs, Directive, Pipe...)
  If you develop the whole application, the learning curve is almost the same as each other
- Performance (only rendering): Better : Good (it is very slightly slower than React)
  The performance issues of an application are not the problem of a library.
- Web Standard Component: No (Virtual DOM) : Yes (<https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/>).
- Data Binding: Uni-directional (Readonly props) : Bi-directional (Input/Output, Dynamic binding), ex) form fields
